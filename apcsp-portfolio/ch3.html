              Q1. Explain the meaning of the statements shown here, both in AP CSP pseudocode and App Inventor. For example, suppose the variable X has the value 10 before the statement is executed. What value would it have after the statement is executed.
            </p>
            <img src="media/example.png">
            <p class="answer">
              A1. The value of X would be set to the initial X value plus 1. In app inventor this would mean the value of the variable called X is being added to 1 and that value is then stored once again in the variable X. The value X after the execution of this code would be 11.

            <p>
              Q2. One aspect of abstraction is that it helps to reduce details to focus on what's relevant. How does the use of a variable, such as dotsize, instead of a value, such as '5', help to reduce detail and focus on what is essential in this program.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. It helps as you are able to view 5 as not just a number now but as a value for the size of a dot, which can then be manipulated and used.

            <p class="answer">
              A2.  JPEG is a lossy compression technique meaning it compresses an image to save memory by compressing it's pixels, which causes it to lose it's quality permanently.

              Q1. For enhancement #5 (the if block exercise) give a brief description of your solution to this problem. Provide a screenshot of your code -- the revised blocks -- and describe how the if/else block works to solve the problem in this case. If appropriate, include a description of any significant problems or bugs you encountered in solving this problem.  App Inventor now has a Download Blocks as Image feature (right click on the white space in the blocks editor to choose) that also can be used to take a screenshot of all of your code or the Windows snipping tool can be used.

              A1. My teammate and I wrote an if/else statement which compares the value of the pen size, which increments or decrements as you click the size up or size down button, to the 0. If the pen size is less than 0, then the pen size will set to 0, if not the function will continue as is. This solves the problem as the pen size will never become less than 0, as the if/else statement catches and changes it before it does.

              Q2. When you use the Camera component to take a picture as the Canvas background, explain why the picture goes away when the app is restarted. HINT: Think about the different hardware components we talked about in an earlier lesson and where on the device the picture is stored. What do you think could be done to prevent the picture from disappearing when the app is restarted?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. The picture is stored within the RAM temporarily, thus when the app is restarted that memory is wiped and renewed. We can prevent it from erasing by instructing the app to save the data in a more permanent spot, such as in the ROM or in a database.

              Q1. (POGIL) Describe an algorithm for identifying the card that was flipped.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. Odd Parity = If there are any face up cards in a row or column that add up to an even number, add another parity card to make it odd. After the card is flipped, look for any row or column that has an even amount of cards face up: the card in the row and column with an even number of face up cards is the one that was flipped over.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              Even Parity = Do the same as the odd except instead add parity cards so that the face up cards add to an even number. After a card has been flipped, check for cards in a row or column that add up to an odd number: the card that is in the row and column that has an odd number of face up cards is the one that was flipped.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q2. (POGIL) The card "trick" shows that it is always possible to identify the card that was flipped as long as only one card was flipped. Would it be possible always to determine if an error occurred if two cards were flipped? 
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
             A2. It is possible if the cards flipped are in different row and columns, else you'd have to use the checksum method.

              Q1. Explain how the error card trick from the Error Detection lesson uses a parity scheme. Was it an even or odd parity scheme?
            </p>
            <p class= "answer">
              A1. The error card trick checks the number of odd or even cards to determine whether an error has occured, making it a parity scheme. It can be either an even or odd scheme, it depends on the cards placed.
