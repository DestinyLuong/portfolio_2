              Q1. In your own words, describe what event driven programming is. What event handler was used in the I Have a Dream app? How was it used?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. Event driven programming is when a program uses conditionals to complete a function. The button click handler was used in the I Have A Dream app. It was used to detect if the user had clicked the button and if they did run a set of instructions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q2. Is it possible to create an app without event driven programming? Explain.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. No it is not possible to create an app without event based programming, as an app is characterized as software designed to fufill the purpose of the user. Without user input the app does not meet the requirements of what an app is supposed to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q3. What elements and components make up the User Interface (UI) for the I Have A Dream app?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A3. Elements and components include buttonsa and canvases, which the user is able to interact with.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q4. What are some of the elements that make up the UI for a car? A vending machine?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A4. The UI of the car includes the steering wheel, gas pedal, gear stick, key hole, and other buttons. For a vending machine it would be the place to stick in money and the buttons.

              Q1. In your own words, give a sentence that would explain to a friend the difference between the WWW and the Internet.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. WWW means world wide web and is a service on or within the internet, while the internet is an interconnected set of computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q2.(POGIL) List a beneficial effect and a harmful effect for a social media app that you discussed in your POGIL group. Are the effects on society, culture, or economics? Include a screenshot of the Venn diagram you made with your group.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. Beneficial effects would be that you are able to share pictures and posts with friends and family easier. A harmful effect would be risk of exposure of privacy. These effects are both societal and cultural. They could be economic if the shared post has to do with cash. 
            </p>
            <img src="media/pogilTwoThree.png">
            <p>
              Q3. (POGIL) If you were a developer of one of the social media apps that you discussed, how would you reduce the harmful effects?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A3. For Instagram, we would disable likes or disable comments so it would reduce cyber bullying, hate, and other harmful effects it can have to others in the app. For Snapchat, identify inappropriate content so it would block the image or delete it to create a safer community.

              Q1. What components make up the User Interface (UI) for this enhanced version of the I Have A Dream app?
            </p>
            <p class= "answer">
              A1. The components are buttons. I only included buttons as that is the only thing used for the user to interact with the app and tablet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q2. A computational artifact is something created by a human using a computer. We've just created a mobile app, which is certainly an example of such a artifact.  Given examples from your own experience of computational artifacts that you've created -- images, videos, presentations, mash-ups -- and describe the software you used to create them.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. One example of a computational artifact is this portfolio. The software I used is an IDE called Repl.it which can be accessed by a browser. Most IDE's are softwares taht must be downloaded, but this one is not. I also created a video project for AME, which can be counted as a computational artifact. For this, I used the software Adobe Premiere Pro which is mainly used to edit videos.

              Q1. Give an example of a special purpose computer that you are familiar with and briefly describe its hardware and its software.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. A special purpose computer is a POS tablet as it is only used for restraunts to send and recieve orders and information. The hardware would be a a credit card slider, a touch screen, receipt printers, pole displays, cash drawers, motherboard, and more. It's software helps to run your business in sales, inventory, accounting, payroll, customer tracking and marketing.
            </p>

              Q2. Explain in your own words the difference between running your app by "Connecting to the Companion" and running your app by "Packaging" it.
            </p> 
            <p class="answer">
              A2. The connection to the Companion App allows the android device to read the code and run it, which helps individuals test their app as they code. Packaging the app allows an android to download the code and run it. This is better for development as the app does not get updates live and isn't easily used for testing.
            </p>
             <p>
               Q3. As we learned in this lesson, a byte is about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter 't'. There are approximately 7 million characters in all of the Harry Potter novels combined. How many bytes of memory would all of the Harry Potter novels take up? How many copies of the Harry Potter novels would fit on a 7 Gigabyte flash drive. (Remember 1 Gigabyte is 1 billion bytes.)
            </p> 
            <p class="answer">
              A3. 7 million bytes would be taken up. 1 thousand copies of the series would take up a 7 Gigabyte flashdrive.

              Q1. In this lesson, you created your own sound board app. Give a brief description of it here. Describe its theme, if it has one, and what particular sounds (music or speeches) it plays.  Click on Add Files at the bottom of the page to attach your video (or if you uploaded your video to youtube, use insert/youtube from the option above to embed your video in your portfolio page).
            </p>
            <p class= "answer">
              A1. Our app is a Nature Sounds themed app, which plays a sound whenever you touch the screen. If you slide the screen it will bring you to the next screen as well as stop the sounds coming from the other. The sounds played are once again related to nature, being ocean, wind, and rain noises.

              Q3. Now that you've had some experience building apps in App Inventor, what do you think about programming. Is it a creative activity? In what ways does it allow you to express yourself?
            </p>
            <p class= "answer">
              A3. Programming is definitely a creative activity as whatever you are building cna be designed in anyway you want. The design portion of the app does not even have to be an artistic thing, design could include the way the app works, how it functions, as well as what code you chose to build it from. In a way you are able to express a lot about your values and what you want others to experience when they try out your app.

              Q1. Write an explanation of abstraction, including at least one example, in your own words.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. An abstraction is a simple symbol or concept for something that everyone is able to associate it with. For example with a logo, the logo is not the actual company, but it is a symbol that everyone looks at and knows that it is representing that company. 
            </p>
             <p>
              Q2. Give 2-3 examples of abstractions in everyday life not identified in the lecture.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. One example would be a drawing of a tree. Whenever anyone draws a tree, they draw a thick vertical pole and then a cloud at the top. Althought that symbol is not an actual tree, eveyone connects it to a tree as it has similar features. Another example would be the peace sign. The peace sign is not the literal concept of peace, however when someone puts of two fingers others understand that it is the sign for peace as everyone uses it often for that purpose.
            </p>
             <p>
              Q3. Consider an example of software, a mobile application, or a web site and explain how it is an abstraction
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A3. Desmos, a mathematical graphing app is an abstraction as it creates graphs for the user. Each value inputed into the computer requires a lot of operation, however as the user wants to ignore that and focus on the graph, the app hides this calculation and gives the user the graph. As Desmos simplifies line equations and graphs it is considered an abstraction, or a simplified concept.

              Q1. What is a bit and what does it mean to say that "it's all just bits"? (Koan 1) Give examples of the things today that are stored in bits?
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A1. A bit is a small unit of data that is essentially a binary digit. When the book talks about bits they are talking about how everything nowadays are stored on computers and that memory is really just a bunch of bits. Some things stored in bits are characters/text, pixels, and digital memory.

              Q2. Describe, in your own words, Moore's Law.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A2. Moore's Law is the idea that the cost of computers are halved every year while the number of transitors on the microchip doubles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q3. Give an example of how the digital explosion is "neither good nor bad" but has both positive and negative implications.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A3. The digital explosion is positive as more people can connect in the world and communicate faster and easier, however this means that their privacy can be easily leaked and that everything can be recorded into the digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Q4. Find and summarize a news article that talks about the positive or negative impacts of a computing innovation. Is the technology itself positive or negative? Or have people used the technology in positive and/or negative ways?    
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              A4. "Positive & Negative Effects of Computers" is an article about the pros and cons of using digital devices. For positive the article mentions that with the help of computers information can be accessed very easily, everything can now be automated, and everything is fast and accurrate. Furthermore, computers have created leisure time through the creation of videogames and digital media. Negatives lie in the fact that computers are coming between individual's face to face social time. There is also the idea of loss of privacy, in which it is very easy to release private data to others on the internet. The technology itself I believe is not negative, it is the way people are using it. People have to be able to limit themselves and monitor their use and their family members use of the internet and their personal data on it.
